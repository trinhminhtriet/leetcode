# Intuition

The problem requires counting the number of unique XOR triplet values from all possible triplets (i, j, k) in a permutation of integers from 1 to n. Given the constraints (n can be as large as 10^5), a brute-force approach is infeasible. Instead, we observe a pattern in the number of unique XOR values based on the size of the array, especially for larger values of n.

# Approach

1. **Small Arrays (n ≤ 2)**:

   - For arrays of size 1, the only possible triplet is the single element itself, so the result is 1.
   - For arrays of size 2, the unique XOR values are derived from combinations of the two elements, resulting in 2 unique values.

2. **Larger Arrays (n ≥ 3)**:
   - The number of unique XOR values seems to follow a pattern related to powers of 2. Specifically, for n ≥ 3, the number of unique XOR values is determined by the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to n. This is calculated as `1 << (near + 1)`, where `near` is the logarithm base 2 of n, rounded down.

# Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(1) for the given approach. The operations involve simple arithmetic and bit manipulation, which are constant time regardless of the input size.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as no additional space is used beyond a few variables to store intermediate results.

This approach efficiently leverages mathematical patterns to avoid the computationally expensive brute-force method, making it suitable for large input sizes as specified in the problem constraints.

# Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniqueXorTriplets(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 1 || n == 2) {
            return n;
        }
        int near = (int)(Math.log(n) / Math.log(2));
        return 1 << (near + 1);
    }
}
```
