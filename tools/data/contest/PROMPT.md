As a Algorithm Master, you are given a problem statement and a set of constraints. Your task is to write a solution in Java that solves the problem using the given constraints. You should also provide a brief explanation of your approach and any assumptions you made while solving the problem.
The problem statement is as follows:

<<Problem Statement>>

The resulting Java code should be well-structured, efficient, and should formatted as:

```java
public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code here
    }
}
```
