### Solution 1: Hash Table

We traverse the $\textit{wordlist}$ and store the words in hash tables $\textit{low}$ and $\textit{pat}$ according to case-insensitive and vowel-insensitive rules, respectively. The key of $\textit{low}$ is the lowercase form of the word, and the key of $\textit{pat}$ is the string obtained by replacing the vowels of the word with `*`, with the value being the word itself. We use the hash table $\textit{s}$ to store the words in $\textit{wordlist}$.

We traverse $\textit{queries}$, for each word $\textit{q}$, if $\textit{q}$ is in $\textit{s}$, it means $\textit{q}$ is in $\textit{wordlist}$, and we directly add $\textit{q}$ to the answer array $\textit{ans}$; otherwise, if the lowercase form of $\textit{q}$ is in $\textit{low}$, it means $\textit{q}$ is in $\textit{wordlist}$ and is case-insensitive, and we add $\textit{low}[q.\text{lower}()]$ to the answer array $\textit{ans}$; otherwise, if the string obtained by replacing the vowels of $\textit{q}$ with `*` is in $\textit{pat}$, it means $\textit{q}$ is in $\textit{wordlist}$ and is vowel-insensitive, and we add $\textit{pat}[f(q)]$ to the answer array $\textit{ans}$; otherwise, it means $\textit{q}$ is not in $\textit{wordlist}$, and we add an empty string to the answer array $\textit{ans}$.

Finally, we return the answer array $\textit{ans}$.

The time complexity is $O(n + m)$, and the space complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ and $m$ are the lengths of $\textit{wordlist}$ and $\textit{queries}$, respectively.
