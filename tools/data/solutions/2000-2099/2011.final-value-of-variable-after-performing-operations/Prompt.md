### Solution 1: Counting

We traverse the array $\textit{operations}$. For each operation $\textit{operations}[i]$, if it contains `'+'`, we increment the answer by $1$, otherwise, we decrement the answer by $1$.

The time complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the array $\textit{operations}$. The space complexity is $O(1)$.
